**Q1. What are the differences in opening the files you found between the two programs?**

In excel, the file --> open procedure does not allow to define column separator
or character set, which leads to errors in the data after opening. In order to 
be able to have these configurations, it is necessary to do an import from the Data manu.

In Libreoffice Calc, these options - character set, column separator - are provided
immediately at the import panel.

**Q2. What is the importance of controlling character encoding in data sets?**

The character set chosed to save a data table should support all special characters 
that a file contains, otherwise these special characters will be replaced by others,
creating data errors. The selection of the character set is also important when 
exchanging data between software or platforms, where it should be defined which 
character set is used, in order to avoir errors in data.

**Q3. How can the procedures performed help improve data quality?**

These operations in a spreadsheet allow to get consistency in data, and minimize
errors cause by typos.
